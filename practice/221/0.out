The  Declaration  of  Independence was a
statement  adopted  by  the  Continental
Congress   on   July   4,   1776,  which
announced  that  the  thirteen  American
colonies  then at war with Great Britain
regarded   themselves   as   independent
states,  and  no  longer  a  part of the
British  Empire.  Written  primarily  by
Thomas  Jefferson, the Declaration was a
formal  explanation  of why Congress had
voted  on July 2 to declare independence
from  Great  Britain,  more  than a year
after   the  outbreak  of  the  American
Revolutionary  War.  The birthday of the
United  States  of  America-Independence
Day-is celebrated on July 4, the day the
wording  of the Declaration was approved
by                             Congress.
