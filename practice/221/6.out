The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will close the nation's largest transit system ahead of Hurricane
Sandy,  shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday evening as the storm advances toward the
New  York  City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m. Sunday, with no transit service expected
at  least  through  the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of the storm should be felt throughout New
York  City.  More  on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation Order Map of the NYC's Evacuation Zones

headed  north  off  the  U.S.  East  Coast  on  Saturday after leaving 58 people dead across the Caribbean,
following a path that could see it blend with a winter storm and hit the U.S. East Coast with a large storm
early  in the week. Follow real-time coverage in the 2012 Storm Season stream . Final trains will depart at
7  p.m.  and  buses  at  9  p.m.  Metro-North  and  Long Island Rail Road trains will also make their final
departures  at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each others' passengers. "We want people staying in
their  homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing the suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to
fully  shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily operates 24 hours per day. The system will be
fully  closed  by  3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later Sunday afternoon, the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the PATH train in Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m.
Monday  on  account  of  the storm. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for
low-lying  zones  in  the city, and announced that public transit will be suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday
evening.  In  preparation  for  Hurricane  Sandy's  arrival,  Gov. Cuomo ordered the MTA to suspend service
beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail Road service will also stop at that time. Service
is  expected  to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown appeared likely to last for days, officials said,
and  would depend on the extent of flooding and the length of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult
to  predict,  but  I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to be difficult days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota
said.  "Wednesday  we  should  have  service,  but  whether it's a full complement of service, it'd be very
difficult  for  me  to  say  now.  I  don't know when this event will end and when the power issues will be
corrected."  The  agency  has  previously said it would impose speed restrictions on its bridges, and would
shut  them  down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full shutdown by the MTA is the first since
Hurricane  Irene  in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for the city's commuters and workers. The
MTA  carries  8.5  million  passengers during an average weekday on subways, buses and commuter trains that
reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into Connecticut as far as New Haven. The shutdown
is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A key objective for the agency on Sunday: moving
thousands  of  buses  and  subway cars out of low-lying parking lots and yards that could be hit by a storm
surge,  including  the  148th  Street  Lenox  Terminal yard in Harlem and the Coney Island yard in southern
Brooklyn,  the  largest  rapid-transit  yard  in  the  U.S.  On Sunday, MTA workers were moving trains from
low-lying  areas  to  safe  underground  storage  spots, including express tracks on the more than 700-mile
subway  system.  Workers  also  secured  vulnerable  electronic  equipment that could be susceptible to the
corrosive  saltwater  of  a  storm  surge.  Last year, as Irene passed through the region at tropical-storm
strength,  the  MTA  dodged  a  bullet.  Storm  surges  were not as invasive as feared, and much electrical
equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't damaged by
saltwater.  "During  Irene,  we  were  very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said. Restoring
train  service  after  the  storm  will  require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials said,
including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like downed
trees  and  drains clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA shutdown
on  the  advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation with New
York  City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to help with
the  storm. Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from low-lying areas
in  New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island, Suffolk County
Executive  Steve  Bellone  said the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire Island on Sunday.
Other  transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching storm. Amtrak has
canceled  all trains on the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down service at 4 p.m., Gov.
Chris  Christie's  staff  announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and light rail lines, with
all  service  suspended  by  2  a.m.  Closures  will  start earlier near the shore - the final train out of
Atlantic  City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said the agency expects
airlines  to  halt  flights  to  the  region's  airports  at some point Sunday, but decisions on curtailing
activity  will  be  left  to  individual  airlines.  The airports will remain open, the spokesman said. The
AirTrain  service  will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports, but
will  be  halted  if  winds  exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's

Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,

about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday

Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,

Storm  Season  stream  . Final trains will depart at 7 p.m. and buses at 9 p.m. Metro-North and Long Island
Rail  Road  trains  will  also make their final departures at 7 p.m., and will cross-honor tickets for each
others' passengers. "We want people staying in their homes," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, in announcing
the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of

full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said

PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
subways,  buses  and  commuter  trains  that  reach  north  of the city, east along Long Island and up into
Connecticut  as far as New Haven. The shutdown is a matter of complexity and risk-management for the MTA. A
key  objective for the agency on Sunday: moving thousands of buses and subway cars out of low-lying parking
lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

lots and yards that could be hit by a storm surge, including the 148th Street Lenox Terminal yard in Harlem
and  the  Coney Island yard in southern Brooklyn, the largest rapid-transit yard in the U.S. On Sunday, MTA
workers were moving trains from low-lying areas to safe underground storage spots, including express tracks
on the more than 700-mile subway system. Workers also secured vulnerable electronic equipment that could be
susceptible  to  the corrosive saltwater of a storm surge. Last year, as Irene passed through the region at
tropical-storm  strength,  the  MTA  dodged a bullet. Storm surges were not as invasive as feared, and much
electrical equipment--including part of the signal system that controls train movements underground--wasn't
damaged  by  saltwater.  "During  Irene, we were very lucky that that didn't happen," an MTA official said.
Restoring  train  service after the storm will require a time-consuming review of damage, transit officials
said,  including  sending  workers  to  walk the miles of subway tracks to look for and address damage like
downed  trees  and  drains  clogged with flood-borne debris. Mr. Cuomo made the decision to call for an MTA
shutdown  on  the advice of the transit authority's leadership. The MTA has also been in close consultation
with  New  York City officials. Mr. Cuomo also said he had called up 1,100 members of the National Guard to
help  with  the  storm.  Mayor  Michael  Bloomberg  on Sunday ordered the evacuation of 370,000 people from
low-lying areas in New York City. He also moved to close all city public schools on Monday. On Long Island,
Suffolk  County  Executive  Steve  Bellone  said  the government had ordered a mandatory evacuation of Fire
Island  on Sunday. Other transportation services around the city have also been affected by the encroaching
storm.  Amtrak  has  canceled  all  trains  on  the Northeast Corridor. NJ Transit will begin shutting down
service  at  4 p.m., Gov. Chris Christie's staff announced. The system will begin closing all rail, bus and
light  rail  lines,  with  all service suspended by 2 a.m. Closures will start earlier near the shore - the
final  train out of Atlantic City will depart for Philadelphia at 2:43 p.m. A Port Authority spokesman said
the agency expects airlines to halt flights to the region's airports at some point Sunday, but decisions on
curtailing activity will be left to individual airlines. The airports will remain open, the spokesman said.
The  AirTrain  service will continue running to and from Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports,
but  will be halted if winds exceed 30 miles per hour. Like the MTA, the Port Authority will make decisions
about closing bridges and tunnels on "a case by case basis" the spokesman said, but closures are considered
"highly  likely  beginning  tomorrow."  The  Metropolitan  Transportation Authority will close the nation's
largest transit system ahead of Hurricane Sandy, shutting down subway, commuter rail and bus service Sunday
evening  as  the storm advances toward the New York City region. The MTA will begin shutting down at 7 p.m.
Sunday,  with  no transit service expected at least through the early hours of Tuesday, when the effects of
the  storm  should  be felt throughout New York City. More on Sandy Parts of New York City Under Evacuation

the  suspension. It takes eight to 10 hours to fully shut down the New York subway system, which ordinarily
operates  24  hours  per  day.  The  system will be fully closed by 3 a.m. Monday, the governor said. Later
Sunday  afternoon,  the  Port  Authority of New York and New Jersey also announced it would fully close the
PATH  train  in  Manhattan and New Jersey at 12:01 a.m. Monday on account of the storm. New York City Mayor
Michael  Bloomberg ordered mandatory evacuations for low-lying zones in the city, and announced that public
transit  will  be  suspended beginning 7 p.m. Sunday evening. In preparation for Hurricane Sandy's arrival,
Gov.  Cuomo  ordered  the  MTA to suspend service beginning 7 p.m. Sunday. Metro North and Long Island Rail
Road  service  will also stop at that time. Service is expected to be suspended until Tuesday. The shutdown
appeared likely to last for days, officials said, and would depend on the extent of flooding and the length
of time needed to restore power. "It's difficult to predict, but I do think Monday and Tuesday are going to
be  difficult  days," MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said. "Wednesday we should have service, but whether it's a
full complement of service, it'd be very difficult for me to say now. I don't know when this event will end
and  when  the  power  issues  will  be  corrected."  The  agency has previously said it would impose speed
restrictions  on  its bridges, and would shut them down entirely if winds reach 60 miles per hour. The full
shutdown  by the MTA is the first since Hurricane Irene in 2011, and it presents a formidable challenge for
the  city's  commuters  and  workers.  The  MTA carries 8.5 million passengers during an average weekday on
